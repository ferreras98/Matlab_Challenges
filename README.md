# Matlab_Challenges
This repository contains some mathematical challenges solved in Matlab. This challenges have a really high level on 'mathematical concepts'.  
The statements of this test are not published, because they dont bellow to me. But if you feel curiosity, contact with me and i'll share with
you and explain to you whatever is needed.

Inside the main folder, you can find 4 different challenges (the difficulty level is increasing with them). Inside 2,3,4 challenges we find some 
'auxiliar functions I didn't create them. But they are needed to execute the solution code.
